**Physical Activity Foundations**

1. **Physical Activity Terminology**
    Physical activity literacy begins with a clear understanding of the terminology utilized within the field. While some terms are used interchangeably, it is important to recognize the nuanced differences which exist in physical activity vocabulary. Review the following terms, and complete the accompanying comprehension checks.

    Physical Activity: Any bodily movement that is produced by skeletal muscles and requires energy expenditure (calories “burned”). Physical activity is often divided into four domains: Domestic/household, transportation, occupational, and leisure-time (Caspersen, Powell, & Christenson, 1985; Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008). Examples of the various domains of physical activity are as follows:

    Domestic/household: vacuuming, completing yardwork, clearing the dishes
    Transportation: biking to work, walking to school, rollerblading to the store
    Occupational: lifting or hauling weights for work or engaging in exerting physical activity during a work-related task
    Leisure-time: physical activity which is completed in an individual’s leisure-time (i.e., swimming, jogging, hiking, dancing, participating in weight-training regimens, etc.)
    Note: Exercise is a subcategory of physical activity, and is included in leisure-time activity.

    ADL: ADLs are activities of daily living, which often involve physical activity. ADLs may often be interchanged with the term “lifestyle activities.” Some examples of ADL’s include: gardening, doing dishes, mowing the lawn, or walking to school (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015).

    Exercise: A subcategory of physical activity that is planned and structured. Exercise involves repetitive bodily movement, and is performed with the goal to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness (Caspersen, Powell, & Christenson, 1985; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Two broad categories of exercise include aerobic and anaerobic exercise.
    Exercise involves repetitive bodily movement, and is performed with the goal to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness.

    - Aerobic Exercise (Oxygen is utilized in the energy-generating process for muscle contraction):

    Exercise which:

    1.primarily uses the large muscle groups of the body
    2.is typically performed continuously
    3.can be maintained for a longer duration of time than anaerobic exercise
    4.improves cardiorespiratory endurance (Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008).
    Several examples of aerobic exercise include jogging, rowing, and biking.

    -Anaerobic Exercise (Oxygen is not utilized in the energy-generating process for muscle contraction):

    Exercise which uses muscles at high-intensity for shorter bursts of time (Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008).
    Several examples of anaerobic exercise include short sprints and heavy weight lifting.

    Resistance Training (Muscle-Strengthening Activities): Exercise which is primarily intended to increase skeletal muscle strength, endurance, power, and mass (Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008).
