2. **High-intensity resistance exercise:**
   - This type of exercise, when performed safely, will help more than low- to moderate-intensity exercise.

4. **Avoid crashing during or after a workout :**
   - People who use insulin should lower their levels or supplement with carbs to avoid a crash during or after their workout. 

5. **For those who usebeta blockers:**

instead of before them.
Doing so will let you take advantage
of exercise’s blood glucose-stabilizing
benefits.
