# CONDITION: Hypertension
# GUIDELINE SOURCE: ACSM Scientific Statement (Exercise for the Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension)

## DEFINITION & DIAGNOSIS
- **Criteria:** Hypertension is defined as resting systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg OR resting diastolic BP ≥ 80 mmHg, or currently taking antihypertensive medication.
- **"White Coat" Warning:** Approximately 25% of patients may have "White Coat Hypertension" (high readings only in a doctor's office). If suspected, refer to a healthcare provider for ambulatory monitoring.

## BENEFITS OF EXERCISE (THE "WHY")
- **Primary Benefit:** Regular aerobic exercise lowers resting systolic BP by 5–7 mmHg.
- **Clinical Impact:** This reduction translates to a reduced risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) by 20–30%.
- **"Law of Initial Values":** Exercise is most effective for those with higher baseline blood pressure. Patients with the highest starting BP often see the greatest reductions.

## EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION (THE "FITT" FORMULA)
### 1. Frequency (How Often?)
- **Aerobic Recommendation:** 5–7 days per week.
- **Why so often?** A single bout of aerobic exercise creates "Post-Exercise Hypotension" (lowering BP) that lasts up to 24 hours. Therefore, daily or near-daily exercise is required to maintain this benefit.
- **Resistance Recommendation:** 2–3 days per week.

### 2. Intensity (How Hard?)
- **Aerobic Level:** Moderate Intensity (40–60% VO2R).
- **Subjective Measure:** On a scale of 6–20 (Borg Scale), aim for 11–14 ("Somewhat Hard").
- **Physiological Sign:** Exercise should cause noticeable increases in heart rate and breathing.
- **Emerging Evidence:** Vigorous intensity may reduce BP further, but the risk-to-benefit ratio is not yet fully established. Progression to vigorous intensity should only be considered for individuals who are willing, able, and medically cleared.

### 3. Time (How Long?)
- **Duration:** Minimum of 30 minutes (up to 60 min) of continuous or accumulated exercise per day.
- **Short Bouts Option:** Short bouts (3–10 minutes) interspersed throughout the day are effective. This is a viable strategy for patients with limited time.

### 4. Type (What Kind?)
- **Primary Focus:** Prolonged, rhythmic activities using large muscle groups (e.g., Walking, Cycling, Swimming).
- **Secondary Focus:** Dynamic Resistance Training (2–4 sets of 8–12 repetitions for major muscle groups).
- **Flexibility:** Hold stretches 10–30 seconds, 2–4 times per muscle group.

## CONTRAINDICATIONS & SAFETY WARNINGS (RED LIGHT)
- **Valsalva Maneuver Rule:** Strictly AVOID holding breath while lifting weights.
- **Reason:** Breath-holding causes extreme spikes in blood pressure, dizziness, or fainting. Patients must breathe rhythmically during resistance training.
- **Progression Rule:** Avoid large increases in intensity. Increase **duration** first (over 4–6 weeks), and only increase intensity after the patient has adapted.

## PROTOCOLS: MEASURING BLOOD PRESSURE CORRECTLY
- **Pre-Measurement Rule:** Avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 24 hours before a baseline assessment.
- **Patient Positioning:**
  1. Seated quietly for >5 minutes (no talking).
  2. Legs uncrossed and feet flat on the floor.
  3. Back supported upright.
  4. Arm supported at heart level.
  5. Bladder empty.
- **Measurement Standard:** Measure 3 times in each arm, separated by 1 minute, and average the results.

## SCREENING & MEDICAL CLEARANCE
- **Pre-Participation:** Although exercise is generally safe, sedentary adults with known CVD who wish to start *vigorous* exercise need medical clearance.
- **Medication Note:** Be aware of concomitant drug therapy (beta-blockers, etc.) which may alter heart rate response to exercise.

Condition: Hypertension
Source: Pescatello et al. (2015) - "Exercise for Hypertension: A Prescription Update"
DOI: 10.1007/s11906-015-0600-y
Topic: Mechanism of Action (PEH) & Emerging Modalities
Key Finding: Immediate BP drop after exercise (PEH) is the primary driver of benefits.
Emerging Strategy: Isometric Resistance Training (Wall sits/Handgrip) is highly effective.

# SOURCE: Exercise for Hypertension: A Prescription Update (Pescatello, 2015)
## THE "PEH" RULE (Why Frequency > Intensity)
- **Concept:** Post-Exercise Hypotension (PEH).
- **Finding:** A single bout of aerobic exercise lowers blood pressure by 5–7 mmHg immediately.
- **Duration:** This effect persists for up to **24 hours**.
- **Clinical Rule:** Because the effect is transient (wears off after a day), patients with hypertension are encouraged to exercise on **most, preferably all, days of the week**.
- **Analogy:** Think of exercise like a daily medication pill—you have to take it every day for it to work.

## UPDATED FITT PRESCRIPTION
- **Frequency:** Most, preferably all, days of the week (due to PEH).
- **Intensity:** Moderate intensity (40–<60% VO2R) is preferred.
  - *Reason:* Moderate intensity is just as effective as vigorous intensity for lowering BP but carries lower risk of cardiac events or musculoskeletal injury.
- **Time:** 30–60 minutes per day (continuous or accumulated in bouts of >10 mins).
- **Type:**
  - *Primary:* Aerobic Exercise.
  - *Secondary:* Dynamic Resistance Training.
  - *Emerging:* Isometric Resistance Training.

## EMERGING STRATEGY: ISOMETRIC EXERCISE
- **What is it?** Static muscle contractions (e.g., Wall Sits, Handgrip Dynamometer).
- **Why use it?** Emerging evidence suggests isometric training may lower BP **more** than aerobic training in some specific trials.
- **Protocol (Handgrip):** 4 sets of 2 minutes (held at 30% max effort) with 1-minute rest between sets.
- **Protocol (Wall Sit):** 4 sets of 2 minutes holding a squat position.

## SAFETY & PROGRESSION
- **The "Exaggerated Response" Warning:** Patients with hypertension may have an exaggerated BP rise during *high-intensity* exercise.
- **Progression Logic:** Start with moderate intensity. Only progress to vigorous intensity if the patient has been medically cleared and has tolerated moderate exercise well for several weeks.
